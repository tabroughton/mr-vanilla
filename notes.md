# Notes

## Considerations

 - Is it an anitpattern to have a single jest instance in root or allow multiple test scripts so nx can cache and parallelise 

## To Do

- work out why    dependsOn:     { "projects": "dependencies", "target": "genEnvVars", "params": "forward" } isn't working as dependsOn .
